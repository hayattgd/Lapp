# Setup environment

## Install editor
<div class="important">You can skip this if you already have one.</div>

I'd like to recommend you to use [Visual studio code (vscode)](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Cursor](https://cursor.com). since both are lightweight and has a lot of extensions.

You can download these editors like how to download normal applications.

##  Organize with folders

Keep organized to keep motivated. you can easily organize with folders!

Create folder and name it your website name. we are going to put everything there!

## Create template

Every static website has "index.html". its so special that don't even need to say "index.html" in url.

Uhh, you know, you accessing this website with hayattgd.github.io/Lapp/?p=... right?

but you can put index.html at last. like this:hayattgd.github.io/Lapp/index.html?p=...

and it still works. because theres hidden "index.html"!

so, you have to make one. make it. you can leave it empty for now.
